<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This program looks at the screen of your browser and scans the questions. It then searches the questions online and finds the relevant answers. The program automatically gives input (clicking, typing etc.) through the use of keyboard and mouse automation.

**DISCLAIMER:** It cannot solve matching questions.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to use this program.

### Installation

1. Under the "Releases" section on the right of this page,
   click on the latest tag.
2. Under the "Assets" section at the bottom, download the setup.exe file.
3. Run the setup file and install the program.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Open your browser and go to netacad website. Then open your module exam and click on
"start". Run the CISCO Solver program and press start. Then go to the exam page.

Make sure not to move your mouse or press any keys. Now, sit back and relax!

Just kidding! You still have to make sure that the program is running correctly.
It will sometimes stop, and in that case you have to solve that specific question
yourself and then restart the program.

If in any case you want to stop the program, simply move the mouse to a corner of
the screen or press the stop button in the application.
